Philosophy
==========

Team-based Play
---------------

Our game encourages team-based play as much as possible, by dividing the abilities of each class sufficiently to  make it impossible to play without three cooperative players on your team.

Common Questions
================

What is the game?

Why create this game?

The game takes place on an abstract world with fixed obstacles.

You control a tank, with a set of tools.

How many characters do I control?

Each player controls one character at a time.

What is the main focus?
-----------------------

Filling the map with sand, and then (based on the outcome of the sand battle, winners will be offense, losers will be defense) stunning the other team.
